A project and collection of scripts using a football api to get data about fixtures and stats, storing it in a way that makes analysis repeatable and reusable using `MongoDB`. 

Throughout the project I store my login details `MongoDB` and API keys using conda environments. If you want to know how to do this then you can find out more information from this [article by Brendan Connelly](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-hide-your-api-keys-in-python-fb2e1a61b0a0) and this [video from Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IolxqkL7cD8) which I found very helpful when I was working out the best way to do this.
